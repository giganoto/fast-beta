# fast-beta | Giganoto Admin Monolith


## WIP: Giganoto Beta, Admin Interface to add blogs, courses, etc.


## To Do

- [ ] Write test cases for BE (using unittests and Pytest)
- [ ] Code coverage
- [ ] Documentation generation
- [X] Admin APIs for Blog
- [ ] Admin APIs for Courses
- [X] Login using Google OAuth
- [X] Sentry Integration
- [ ] Admin UI using React JS
- [ ] CI/CD using Github Actions
- [ ] Production deployment scripts (Terraform?)


## ToDo

- Current code faces no single source of truth because of maintaining fields accross API, SQLAlchemy and later on Schema if I use something like Marshmallow or Pedantic, I am looking into SQLModel (https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/features/) for this reason.


## What is Giganoto?

- An E-learning platform which is Free and Open-Source in every possible sense.
